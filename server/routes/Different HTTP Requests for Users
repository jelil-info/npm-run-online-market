           Different HTTP Requests for Users

Listing users with GET
Creating a new user with POST
/api/users/:userId for the following:
Fetching a user with GET
Updating a user with PUT
Deleting a user with DELETE


          mern-skeleton/server/express.js
          
import userRoutes from './routes/user.routes'
...
app.use('/', userRoutes)
...



         mern-skeleton/server/routes/user.routes.js
         
import express from 'express'
import userCtrl from '../controllers/user.controller'
const router = express.Router()
router.route('/api/users')
.get(userCtrl.list)
.post(userCtrl.create)
router.route('/api/users/:userId')
.get(userCtrl.read)
.put(userCtrl.update)
.delete(userCtrl.remove)
router.param('userId', userCtrl.userByID)
export default router


          The user.controller.js file will have the following structure:

import User from '../models/user.model'
import extend from 'lodash/extend'
import errorHandler from './error.controller'
const create = (req, res, next) => { … }
const list = (req, res) => { … }
const userByID = (req, res, next, id) => { … }
const read = (req, res) => { … }
const update = (req, res, next) => { … }
const remove = (req, res, next) => { … }
export default { create, userByID, read, list, remove, update }


                            Auth routes
                            
                            Auth routes
The two auth APIs are defined in the auth.routes.js file using express.Router()
to declare the route paths with the relevant HTTP methods. They're also
assigned the corresponding controller functions, which should be called
when requests are received for these routes.
The auth routes are as follows:
: POST request to authenticate the user with their email
and password
'/auth/signout': GET request to clear the cookie containing a JWT that
was set on the response object after sign-in
'/auth/signin'
The resulting mern-skeleton/server/routes/auth.routes.js file will be as follows:
import express from 'express'
import authCtrl from '../controllers/auth.controller'
const router = express.Router()
router.route('/auth/signin')
.post(authCtrl.signin)
router.route('/auth/signout')
.get(authCtrl.signout)
export default router
A POST request to the signin route and a GET request to the signout route



              The mern-skeleton/server/controllers/auth.controller.js file will have the
following structure:
import User from '../models/user.model'
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken'
import expressJwt from 'express-jwt'
import config from './../../config/config'
const signin = (req, res) => { … }
const signout = (req, res) => { … }
const requireSignin = …
const hasAuthorization = (req, res) => { … }
export default { signin, signout, requireSignin, hasAuthorization }
